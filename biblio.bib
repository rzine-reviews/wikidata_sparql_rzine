  abstract = {This book was written for statisticians, computer scientists, geographers,
	researchers, and others interested in visualizing data. It presents
	a unique foundation for producing almost every quantitative graphic
	found in scientific journals, newspapers, statistical packages,
	and data visualization systems. While the tangible results of this
	work have been several visualization software libraries, this book
	focuses on the deep structures involved in producing quantitative
	graphics from data. What are the rules that underlie the production
	of pie charts, bar charts, scatterplots, function plots, maps, mosaics,
	and radar charts? Those less interested in the theoretical and mathematical
	foundations can still get a sense of the richness and structure
	of the system by examining the numerous and often unique color graphics
	it can produce. The second edition is almost twice the size of the
	original, with six new chapters and substantial revision. Much of
	the added material makes this book suitable for survey courses in
	visualization and statistical graphics.},
